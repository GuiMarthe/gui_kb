I first heard of Dr. Meng during his key not (titled a seemingly random series of binary digits) and the 2019 JSM in Denver.
Since then I've been following his work and this article is golden. 
He tells us about what he calls defines how a statistician can scientifically relevant rather the merely a consultant in research groups. Throughout the article, he exemplifies the principles by telling us about the interaction with an astrophysics research group.
The interaction would begin with a rather imposing/consultant/non-constructive tutorial on how to better estimate the quantities they needed and became a research grant with novel and more appropriate methods for the problem at hand.

He mentions about the importance of communication statistical concepts and teaching reasoning through uncertainty for professionals that are not used to it.

Two papers are interesting to me:
   - the one on the dangers of preprocessing data 
   - the paper on which this article is the main focus (the calibration of measures through statistical methods interests me)
   - the paper on why y ~ x is not the same as x ~ y. He says it should be obvious, but it is not to me and it made me feel bad.
