Ok, so I recommend this article for anyone getting into credit scoring who already knows a bit of statistical or machine learning.
Since it is a benchmark using a) many public credit scoring data sets; b) many types of models (single, homogeneous and heterogeneous ensembles); c) over many types of metrics; it gives a good view of the modelling characteristics of an application scoring model.S
Some nice takeaways are:

- simple models are competitive with more complex modeling schemes
- models that estimate highly non-linear relationships tend to not over perform when compared to more linear relationships estimating techniques.
- a not known to me performance metric called the H-score
