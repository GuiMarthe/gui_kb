> By Stefan Lessmann , Bart Baesens , Hsin-Vonn Seow , Lyn C. Thomas

Ok, so I recommend this article for anyone getting into credit scoring who already knows a bit of statistical or machine learning.
Since it is a benchmark using a) many public credit scoring data sets; b) many types of models (single, homogeneous and heterogeneous ensembles); c) over many types of metrics; it gives a good view of the modelling characteristics of an application scoring model.S
Some nice takeaways are:

- simple models are competitive with more complex modeling schemes
- models that estimate highly non-linear relationships tend to not over perform when compared to more linear relationships estimating techniques.
- a not known to me performance metric called the H-score


### How to Measure Quality of Credit Scoring Models :credit-scoring:

> by Martin Řezáč and František Řezáč (cool names)

The article gives a good run through of how to measure credit scoring models quality. It goes deep onto the mathematics of each quality measure.
Some takeaways are: (i need to review the paper)

### Conducting highly principled data science: a statisticians job and joy :methodology:

> By Xiao-Li-Meng

I first heard of Dr. Meng during his key not (titled a seemingly random series of binary digits) and the 2019 JSM in Denver.
Since then I've been following his work and this article is golden. 
He tells us about what he calls defines how a statistician can scientifically relevant rather the merely a consultant in research groups. Throughout the article, he exemplifies the principles by telling us about the interaction with an astrophysics research group.
The interaction would begin with a rather imposing/consultant/non-constructive tutorial on how to better estimate the quantities they needed and became a research grant with novel and more appropriate methods for the problem at hand.

He mentions about the importance of communication statistical concepts and teaching reasoning through uncertainty for professionals that are not used to it.

Two papers are interesting to me:
   - the one on the dangers of preprocessing data 
   - the paper on which this article is the main focus (the calibration of measures through statistical methods interests me)
   - the paper on why y ~ x is not the same as x ~ y. He says it should be obvious, but it is not to me and it made me feel bad.
